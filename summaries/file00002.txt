This proposal outlines regulations for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in the EU. It is based on extensive stakeholder consultation and impact assessments. The proposal adopts a risk-based approach, categorizing AI systems into three risk levels: unacceptable, high, and low or minimal. Certain AI practices are prohibited due to their potential to violate fundamental rights. High-risk AI systems are subject to specific requirements and obligations, including data handling, transparency, human oversight, and robustness. The proposal also includes measures to support innovation and compliance for small-scale users and providers. The proposal aims to increase trust in AI, provide legal certainty, and prevent market fragmentation. It also includes provisions for monitoring and evaluation, with a review scheduled five years after implementation.
