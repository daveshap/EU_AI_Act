The amendments to various EU regulations and directives mandate that when adopting delegated or implementing acts related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, which are considered safety components, the requirements outlined in Title III, Chapter 2 of the new Regulation on Artificial Intelligence must be considered. This applies to AI systems already in service or on the market, unless significant changes in design or purpose occur. The Commission will annually assess the need for amendments to the list in Annex III after the regulation's enforcement.
