This legislative proposal aims to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) within the European Union (EU). The main goal is to ensure the single market functions properly by creating conditions for the development and use of trustworthy AI. The proposal sets specific requirements for AI systems and obligations for all value chain participants to ensure safety and respect for fundamental rights and Union values. It aims to provide legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in AI, enhance governance and enforcement of existing laws, and prevent market fragmentation. The proposal also outlines performance indicators, including the number of serious incidents involving AI and total AI investment in the EU. The regulation should be fully applicable 18 months after its adoption, with certain governance structures in place beforehand. The proposal argues that a common EU legislative action on AI could boost the internal market and provide European industry with a competitive edge globally.
