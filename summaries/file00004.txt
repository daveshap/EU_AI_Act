This legislation proposes a risk-based approach to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) systems, focusing on high-risk AI systems that could potentially harm human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, and fundamental rights. It prohibits AI practices that manipulate human behavior, exploit vulnerabilities, or enable social scoring by public authorities. It also restricts the use of AI for real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces, except in specific situations related to law enforcement. The legislation mandates that high-risk AI systems comply with requirements related to data quality, technical documentation, transparency, human oversight, and robustness. It also outlines responsibilities for providers, users, and third parties involved in the AI value chain. The legislation emphasizes the role of standardization and conformity assessment in ensuring the trustworthiness of high-risk AI systems.
