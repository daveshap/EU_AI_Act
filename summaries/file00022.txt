The E-commerce Directive 2000/31/EC provides a framework for digital services and cooperation among EU Member States. However, it has shortcomings, including unclear response timeframes and lack of responsiveness, leading to trust issues. The Directive needs a differentiated set of rules at the EU level, requiring a specific cooperation mechanism.

The Regulation Laying Down Harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligence establishes a new framework for AI systems, requiring a new regulatory and coordination function. It complements Digital Europe's priority of promoting AI diffusion. The staff will be redeployed and other costs will be supported from the DEP. envelope.

The proposal has an unlimited duration, with a start-up period followed by full-scale operation. It will be directly managed by the Commission. The Regulation will be reviewed five years after its implementation. The Commission will report the findings to the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Economic and Social Committee.

The Regulation establishes harmonised rules for AI systems, requiring a new advisory group coordinating national authorities' activities. The enforcement of the new Regulation will require 10 FTE. The Board will be supported by the Commission's administrative structure and an expert group for additional expertise.

Existing fraud prevention measures will cover the additional appropriations necessary for this Regulation. The financial impact of the proposal will affect the existing budget lines of the multiannual financial framework.
