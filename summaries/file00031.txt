The proposal requires the use of human resources, with an estimated need for 10 full-time equivalent units each year from 2023 to 2027 and beyond. This includes posts for officials and temporary staff at the headquarters and Commission's Representation Offices. The funding for these resources will come from the DG's existing appropriations and any additional allocations granted under the annual allocation procedure.
