The proposal/initiative allocates total appropriations under Heading 1 of the multiannual financial framework. The total commitments amount to 2.200, with payments also totaling 2.200. If more than one heading is affected, the section is repeated. The total operational appropriations and total appropriations of an administrative nature financed from the envelope for specific programmes are also calculated. The total appropriations under Headings 1 to 6 of the multiannual financial framework are then determined.
