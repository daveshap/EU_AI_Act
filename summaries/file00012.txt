This legislation outlines the procedures for notifying authorities about conformity assessment bodies, which must meet the requirements in Article 33. These bodies assess the conformity of high-risk AI systems. The bodies must be independent, impartial, and maintain confidentiality. They must have sufficient resources, insurance, and competence to carry out their tasks. They must also participate in coordination activities and standardisation organisations. If a body subcontracts tasks, it must ensure the subcontractor meets the same requirements. The Commission assigns identification numbers to these bodies and maintains a public list. If a body no longer meets the requirements or fails its obligations, the notifying authority must investigate and may restrict, suspend or withdraw the notification. The Commission can also investigate and request corrective measures. Conformity assessment bodies in third countries may be authorised to carry out these activities. High-risk AI systems that conform to harmonised standards are presumed to meet the requirements.
