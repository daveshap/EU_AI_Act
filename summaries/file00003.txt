This legislation outlines the European Union's rules for high-risk artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It classifies high-risk AI systems based on their intended purpose and usage, and requires them to comply with mandatory requirements and an ex-ante conformity assessment. The legislation also sets out legal requirements for data governance, transparency, human oversight, and system robustness. It places obligations on providers of high-risk AI systems and other participants in the AI value chain. The legislation also establishes a framework for regulatory sandboxes to test innovative technologies and includes measures to reduce the regulatory burden on SMEs and start-ups. It sets up governance systems at Union and national level, and requires providers of AI systems to register their systems in an EU database. The legislation also includes transparency obligations for certain AI systems and creates a framework for voluntary codes of conduct.
