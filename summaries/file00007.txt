This legislation defines the roles of national supervisory and competent authorities in implementing and applying AI regulations. It prohibits certain AI practices, such as using subliminal techniques or exploiting vulnerabilities to harm individuals, and using AI systems to evaluate or classify individuals' trustworthiness based on their social behavior. The use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in public spaces for law enforcement is also regulated, requiring prior authorization and compliance with necessary safeguards. The legislation classifies certain AI systems as high-risk, including those used as safety components of products covered by Union harmonisation legislation, and empowers the Commission to update the list of high-risk AI systems.
