This legislation outlines the obligations of providers, importers, distributors, users, and other third parties of high-risk AI systems. Providers must keep a copy of the EU declaration of conformity and technical documentation, provide necessary information to demonstrate conformity, and cooperate with national authorities. Importers must ensure the AI system has undergone the appropriate conformity assessment procedure, bears the required conformity marking, and is accompanied by the required documentation. Distributors must verify the AI system's conformity and ensure storage or transport conditions do not jeopardize its compliance. Users must use the AI system according to instructions, monitor its operation, and keep logs. Any distributor, importer, user, or third party that modifies a high-risk AI system or places it on the market under their name is considered a provider. The legislation also outlines the responsibilities of notifying authorities and the application process for a conformity assessment body for notification.
