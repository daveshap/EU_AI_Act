This legislation outlines the administrative fines for non-compliance with AI regulations. Fines can reach up to 30 million EUR or 6% of a company's total worldwide annual turnover. Factors such as the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, previous fines, and the size and market share of the operator are considered when deciding the fine. Member States can decide if public authorities can be fined. The European Data Protection Supervisor can impose fines on Union institutions, agencies, and bodies, with a maximum fine of 500,000 EUR. The legislation also details the delegation of power to the Commission to adopt delegated acts, which can be revoked by the European Parliament or the Council. Amendments are made to Regulations (EC) No 300/2008 and (EU) No 167/2013 to consider AI systems.
