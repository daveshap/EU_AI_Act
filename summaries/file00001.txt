The European Commission proposes a regulation for harmonised rules on Artificial Intelligence (AI), aiming to balance its socio-economic benefits with potential risks. The proposal seeks to ensure AI systems are safe, respect fundamental rights, provide legal certainty for investment and innovation, enhance governance, and prevent market fragmentation. It prohibits certain harmful AI practices, imposes restrictions on remote biometric identification systems, and defines "high-risk" AI systems that must comply with mandatory requirements. The proposal also establishes a governance system at Member State level and a European Artificial Intelligence Board at Union level. It supports innovation through AI regulatory sandboxes and measures to reduce regulatory burden on SMEs and start-ups. The proposal aligns with existing EU legislation and policies, including data protection, consumer protection, non-discrimination, and gender equality.
